## Logistic Regression - Gradient Descent

The code in this repository implements logistic regression by means of gradient descent using a fast
gradient algorithm. In the three example scripts that are provided you can see a demonstration of
this method on a simple, fabricated example, on an example data set provided by An Introduction
to Statistical Learning textbook and see this method compared to the output of Scikit Learn's
*LogisticRegressionCV* function.
